Look and feel

Prior to building my website I examined a number of sites to reflect on elements which appealed to me as something I could use in my website design.

My choice of colours for the website was based on what I saw on historical sites such as the National Trust (https://www.nationaltrust.org.au) and the Yandina Historic House (https://yandinahistorichouse.com.au)

I felt that a logo is an important part of a website.  As there was no logo image, I choose to use the intials of Churchill House (CH).  I saw a similar idea on the NGA website (https://nga.gov.au)
I used a thinner font for the logo to make it crisper and added a border to it, which was inspired by the nav border on http://www.dunnellondepot.com which I though looked like a building, and was then appropriate for a website about a building.

Learnings and challenges

My first real challenge was my header broke when I converted my site to use responsive units, em, instead of px.  Doing some research on this led me change em to rem for most of the elements, except font sizes.

On the page which gives information about Robin Boyd I wanted a clickable link to the Robin Boyd Foundation which would resize nicely.
My solution to this was to utilize a background image in the css, with a repeat setting of space, to ensure that partial images were not visable.












Colours based on National trust Website

Logo - looked at a couple of sites, eg. NGA
Used a different font from the header to make it stand out a bit.

Issues

Working out a sticky header

Changing to em broke the header - used rem instead


Added margins to the mobile versions of image boxes

hero image sizes

Colours

My choice of colours for the website was based on what I saw on historical sites such as the National Trust. https://www.nationaltrust.org.au/ https://yandinahistorichouse.com.au/

As no logo was provided I chose to use the initials of Churchill House, with a border similar to that which I liked from http://www.dunnellondepot.com/

The link to the Robin Boyd website is achived using thier logo as a background image with a repeat option of space, which gives an even distribuation of the logo, with no bits chopped off as the screen is resized.
