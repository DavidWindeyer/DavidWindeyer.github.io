Colours based on National trust Website

Logo - looked at a couple of sites, eg. NGA
Used a different font from the header to make it stand out a bit.

Issues

Working out a sticky header

Changing to em broke the header - used rem instead

Added margins to the mobile versions of image boxes

hero image sizes

Colours

My choice of colours for the website was based on what I saw on historical sites such as the National Trust. https://www.nationaltrust.org.au/ https://yandinahistorichouse.com.au/

As no logo was provided I chose to use the initials of Churchill House, with a border similar to that which I liked from http://www.dunnellondepot.com/
